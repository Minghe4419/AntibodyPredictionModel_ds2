# AntibodyPredictionModel_ds2
This project aims to test effectiveness of a vaccine by developing prediction models for antibody level.

Understanding antibody responses can help inform vaccine effectiveness and identify populations with weaker immune responses. The antibody level measured via dry blood spot (log-transformed) is the primary outcome of interest. Data considered to be potential predictors to understand factors influencing the antibody response are collected in `dat1.RData`. A few months after the initial data collection, a new, independent dataset `dat2.RData`, with the same structure as `dat1.RData`, for the purpose of evaluating robustness and generalizability of the prediction model.
